# MooseTest

This documentation for MOOSE test should not contain any additional pages, with the exception of
MooseTestApp syntax and source pages.

The purpose is to guarantee that the framework/doc content can build as a stand-alone site, as
such there are two config files: "config.yml" and "test_config.yml". The former is setup to
exclude everything, except this file, from the moose/test/doc/content directory.

The later ("test_config.yml") is setup to include the content from MooseTestApp, which in the
future might become something we document further.

The following links are provided for convenience when running and testing this locally.
