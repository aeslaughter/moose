# MkDocs

This is fork of [mkdocs] to enable the following featurers:

1. Including of YAML files inside of another.
2. Allows for watching diretories outside of your docs directory.
3. Limits page reload to files that were editted only.

When these features are added (PR's for 1 and 2 were rejected) or more likely a plugins API is supported this fork will be eliminated.
