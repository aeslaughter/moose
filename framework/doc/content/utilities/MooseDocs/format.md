# MooseDocs Format id=title

## This is a second level heading that is long, the content for this heading should wrap so that id doesn't cross the 100 character limit. id=subtitle class=A really long class that will need to be wrapped across lines, this needs to be longer than 100 lines for it to wrap with the default setting. This is well over 100 so that it wraps multiple times.

```language=cpp id=foo
class A
{
A();
};
```
