# chigger.geometric

The geometric package provides basic geometry source objects (e.g., cubes) that may be added
to the window. Most of the objects within this package are source objects, so they must be
inserted into a [base/ChiggerResult.md], which in turn is used within the window object.
The following lists the available source objects, each link to an example that illustrates
the use of source objects.

- [`CubeSource`](/CubeSource.md)
- [`CylinderSource`](/CylinderSource.md)
- [`LineSource`](/LineSource.md)
- [`PlaneSource`](/PlaneSource.md)
