# WindowUpdateObserver

The WindowUpdateObserver is a stand-alone observer that will automatically call the update method
of the [chigger/RenderWindow.md]. This observer is useful if the data file(s) associated with the
viewer are changing and it is desired that the window automatically detects the changes and
re-renders the data.
