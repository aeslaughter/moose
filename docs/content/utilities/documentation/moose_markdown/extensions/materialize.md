# MaterializeExtension

The MaterializeExtension adds two HTML additions to the converted markdown:
* a copy button is added to all `<pre><code>` blocks and
* the `<h2>` level sections are wrapped in `<div>` block to allow [scrollspy](http://materializecss.com/scrollspy.html) contents to work correctly.

There are no package level or commands for this extension.
