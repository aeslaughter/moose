!syntax description /Kernels/HeatConductionBPD

## Description

The Kernel `HeatConductionBPD` calculates the residual and jacobian of the heat flux integral for 2D, and 3D bond-based peridynamic heat conduction models. More details on the residual and jacobian formulation can be found in [citet:Chen2016bondimplicit].
