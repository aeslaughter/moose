# MOOSE Newsletter (April 2021)

## MooseTools

We are working on separating many of our support tools (e.g., testing, docs, GUI) into a separate
repository: [moosetools](https://github.com/idaholab/moosetools). This is being motivated by the
desire for non-MOOSE projects to use these tools. This migration will be ongoing for the next few
months and we will do our best to minimize the impact to users.

The effort will include major improvements with respect to portability, extensiblity, and
documentation. The end product will be more robust and useful for MOOSE and non-MOOSE applications.
