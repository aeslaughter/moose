## MooseDocs and CIVET Paper Published

We published a paper regarding are SQA practices and the associate the use of MooseDocs and CIVET.
If you are using CIVET for testing and/or MooseDocs for documentation, please reference the
paper listed here: [citing.md#testing-and-documentation].


## Bug Fixes and Minor Changes

- Fix Stochastic Tools to provide a correct Latin Hypercube sample, this also included the addition
  of improved utilities for shuffling, resampling, and swapping (see [shuffle.h](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/blob/next/framework/include/utils/Shuffle.h)).
- MooseDocs now includes the ability to mark content as "external", thus it is possible to include
  syntax pages from another project without having the syntax registered. The page will simply state
  that the object is not available. This negates the need to exclude specific files from the content,
  which was prone to errors and maintenance problems.
