## MooseDocs and CIVET Paper Published

We published a paper regarding are SQA practices and the associate the use of MooseDocs and CIVET.
If you are using CIVET for testing and/or MooseDocs for documentation, please reference the

## Early Construction of Subapps of MultiApps

A design change on MultiApp has been made recently. With this change, MOOSE constructs
the sub-applications (subapps) of MultiApps by default right after when MOOSE adds the
MultiApps to the main application. Previously, the construction of subapps happens
within the initial setup of the main application after the execution of all Actions.
Derived MultiApps can set the private parameter "use_positions" of MultiApp to *false*
to override this behavior and delay the construction as before, which is a feature
required by the sampler MultiApps in the MOOSE stochastic module. This change should
not affect the calculations with MultiApps but allows the main application to inquiry
the subapps for setting up its objects such as kernels, boundary conditions, etc.
accordingly. The design is documented in [MultiApps](syntax/MultiApps/index.md) along
with some other document updates related with MultiApp.

## Bug Fixes and Minor Changes

- Fix Stochastic Tools to provide a correct Latin Hypercube sample, this also included the addition
  of improved utilities for shuffling, resampling, and swapping (see [shuffle.h](https://github.com/idaholab/moose/blob/next/framework/include/utils/Shuffle.h)).
- MooseDocs now includes the ability to mark content as "external", thus it is possible to include
  syntax pages from another project without having the syntax registered. The page will simply state
  that the object is not available. This negates the need to exclude specific files from the content,
  which was prone to errors and maintenance problems.

## libMesh level changes

- The TIMPI library code now includes StandardType and Packing
  specializations for a wider variety of standard containers,
  including tuple and array with both fixed and variable-size
  contents, and including list, set, map, and unordered sets and maps
  with variable-sized contents.
- Fixes for calculations on IsoGeometricAnalysis meshes using rational
  Bezier mappings.
- Configure-time detection (and default use of) C++17 and C++14
  flags from compilers which support them.
- DenseVector and DenseMatrix construction from std::initializer\_list
- Efficiency improvements for JFNK solves
